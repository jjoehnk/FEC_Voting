#### Overview

###### Summary of Topic  

The United States spends more money on elections than any other nation, and even more so following the controversial Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Committee in 2010 that prohibited the government from restricting independent expenditures on political campaigns by third-party groups. 

In this project, the focus is to explore the relationship between funding that comes from special interest groups, in particular from the Super PACs made possible by the Citizens United decision, and the voting behavior of elected congress members who either receive their funding directly or benefit indirectly from their expenditures. 

###### Hypothesis

If we test the variance between the perceived interests of special groups and the voting patterns of congress people they support, there will be little to no difference in ideology between the two groups. Furthermore, if we compare the voting patterns of the congress people who receive funding from the same parties, there will similarly be little to no difference in ideological support between the congress members. 

###### Benefit

There is a wealth of data from the Federal Election Commission on contributions and expenditures by committees during U.S. elections, and this project would create a data extraction pipeline into a database and Tableau application for accessible description and analysis.
